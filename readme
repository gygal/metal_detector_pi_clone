This are files with source files for 3d print components for some metal detector.
I created all components :
arm rest,
hand grip,
holder on search coil,
box for electronic,
two types of clips for mounting hand grip and arm rest

my project you can see at https://brmlab.cz/project/metaldetector

I am a beginner in 3d modeling so I welcome any improvements.(evolutions)
